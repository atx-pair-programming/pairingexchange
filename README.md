PairingExchange
===============

Austin Pair Programming Meetup Project to build a PairingExchange for MEAN programmers to locate a pair programmer and setup a pairing appointment.

## Required and Actual Competencies, Learning Resources, and Learning paths of Pairing Candidates.

## Practice Problems like nodeschool.io for pairing teams to learn from particular problems needing solutions


## High Level Goals of the PairingExchange Project

1. Provide a MEAN Developer community collaboration service for pair programming partners who are learning the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node) Stack.
2. Support both pair and remote pair programmers.
3. Support newbie, beginner, intermediate, advanced, and ninja level developers.
4. Low Barrier graphical access to locate appropriate learning resources for the user's skill level and to locate potential pairing partners of similar or higher skill levels.
5. Provide MEAN community links to learning resources for the various skill levels of MEAN developers.
6. Provide a definition of basic competencies needed for each skill level and MEAN architectural stack component.
7. Provide a framework for mean developers to benchmark their skills against other subject matter experts.
8. Provide graphical competency maps which can act as a portfolio of skills competencies for job postings and a career map for MEAN developers.

## Low Barrier Graphical Navigation and Access (See similar example below compliments of AgileLearner.com)

## Graphical Aids to Identify personal learning paths for various MEAN stack components
 
To make it easier for MEAN developers to organize their learning paths, provide the capability for the creation of competency and resource maps that shows how learning resources and competencies are related. 

See AgileLearner.com's usage of D3.js for this purpose.

## Testable Hypothesis:  The quality of the PairingExchange matches is the richness of the competency maps, the resource maps, and the convergence of the identified learning paths of the participants.
